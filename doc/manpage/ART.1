.SH NAME
ART - An advanced, cross-platform program for developing raw photos.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBART\fP is a fork of RawTherapee, an advanced program for developing raw photos and for processing non-raw photos. It is non-destructive, makes use of OpenMP, supports all the cameras supported by dcraw and more, and carries out its calculations in a high precision 32-bit floating point engine.

.SH SYMBOLS
  <Chevrons> indicate parameters you can change.
  [Square brackets] mean the parameter is optional.
  The pipe symbol | indicates a choice of one or the other.
  The dash symbol - denotes a range of possible values.
.SH SYNOPSIS
  ART GUI
  ART <folder>           Start File Browser inside folder.
  ART <file>             Start Image Editor with file.

  ART CLI
  ART-cli -c <dir>|<files>   Convert files in batch using default parameters.
  ART-cli <other options> -c <dir>|<files>  Convert files in batch using your own settings.
  ART-cli [-o <output>|-O <output>] [-q] [-a] [-s|-S] [-p <one.arp> [-p <two.arp> ...] ] [-d] [ -j[1-100] [-js<1-3>] | [-b<8|16>] [-t[z] | [-n]] ] [-Y] -c <input>
.SH OPTIONS
  -c <files>       Specify one or more input files.
                   -c must be the last option.
  -o <file>|<dir>  Set output file or folder.
                   Saves output file alongside input file if -o is not specified.
  -O <file>|<dir>  Set output file or folder and copy arp file into it.
                   Saves output file alongside input file if -O is not specified.
  -q               Quick-start mode. Does not load cached files to speedup start time.
  -a               Process all supported image file types when specifying a folder, even those
                   not currently selected in Preferences > File Browser > Parsed Extensions.
  -s               Use the existing sidecar file to build the processing parameters,
                   e.g. for photo.raw there should be a photo.raw.arp file in the same folder.
                   If the sidecar file does not exist, neutral values will be used.
  -S               Like -s but skip if the sidecar file does not exist.
  -p <file.arp>    Specify processing profile to be used for all conversions.
                   You can specify as many sets of "-p <file.arp>" options as you like,
                   each will be built on top of the previous one, as explained below.
  -d               Use the default raw or non-raw processing profile as set in
                   Preferences > Image Processing > Default Processing Profile
  -j[1-100]        Specify output to be JPEG (default, if -t and -n are not set).
                   Optionally, specify compression 1-100 (default value: 92).
  -js<1-3>         Specify the JPEG chroma subsampling parameter, where:
                   1 = Best compression:   2x2, 1x1, 1x1 (4:2:0)
                       Chroma halved vertically and horizontally.
                   2 = Balanced (default): 2x1, 1x1, 1x1 (4:2:2)
                       Chroma halved horizontally.
                   3 = Best quality:       1x1, 1x1, 1x1 (4:4:4)
                       No chroma subsampling.
  -b<8|16>         Specify bit depth per channel (default value: 16 for TIFF, 8 for PNG).
                   Only applies to TIFF and PNG output, JPEG is always 8.
  -t[z]            Specify output to be TIFF.
                   Uncompressed by default, or deflate compression with 'z'.
  -n               Specify output to be compressed PNG.
                   Compression is hard-coded to 6.
  -Y               Overwrite output if present.

Your arp files can be incomplete, ART will build the final values as follows:
  1- A new processing profile is created using neutral values,
  2- If the "-d" option is set, the values are overridden by those found in
     the default raw or non-raw processing profile.
  3- If one or more "-p" options are set, the values are overridden by those
     found in these processing profiles.
  4- If the "-s" or "-S" options are set, the values are finally overridden by those
     found in the sidecar files.
  The processing profiles are processed in the order specified on the command line.
